CMSI 387 Operating Systems
	Semester Project
===================================

This is a great idea!  I like the name and the fact that it
reflects what is happening in the system.  Don't forget that
you can write command line "switches" like "-t" or "-k 10" to
do things like sort the output or provide a smaller listing.
You might consider a switch that allows the user to input a
max percentage level so that the output shows only processes
that are above that level.

There are already operating system tools in place that do this
ABOVE the kernel level, as you said with the "ps" command, but 
encapsulating the operations into the kernel is a worthy project!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
