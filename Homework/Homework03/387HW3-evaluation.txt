Comments:
---------
Good explanation for #2 and it will prevent deadlock.  However, this might
lead to "starvation" if one thread can't EVER get the resources it needs.

Which version of python did you use for your program?  I initially got a
syntax error on the print statements, running either the default mac version
of 2.7.10 or using my installed Idle at version 3.5.4.  I corrected it and
the simulation ran great!!

Nice work!
