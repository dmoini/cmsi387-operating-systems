Question 8, excellent report!  It's curious that it takes the
same amount of time no matter what, and that the windows computer
couldn't allocate a 1 billion element array...

Question 9, the tree is actually incorrect.  However, because
we talked about it ahead of time and I told you your tree was
right, I'll have to give you the points.  Let's meet and talk
about what it should look like.

Nice work!
